- 👀 I’m interested in Shiny apps, statistics, AI-ML, and cyber resiliency.
- 🌱 I’m always learning more R, Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Shiny apps for enterprise, statistical analysis and data cleaning.
- 📫 How to reach me: datascientistdudeceo@gmail for business inquiries please.
- 😄 Dad Joke of the Day: Did you hear about the rowboat that got swept away to sea? It was an oar-deal.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a (former) Russian/Ukrainian linguist and they are not my first languages.
