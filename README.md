- 👋 Hi, I’m JT, aka @DSD-resilience, because resilience is a one of the key values of my digital products firm, DSD.
- 👀 I’m interested in Shiny apps, statistics, AI-ML, and cyber resiliency.
- 🌱 I’m always learning more R, Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Shiny apps for enterprise, dashboards for strategic insights, statistical analysis and data cleaning.

- 😄 Dad Joke of the Day: It's tough to get a large Coke in Minneapolis. They only have mini sodas.
