- 👋 Hi, I’m JT, aka @DSD-resilience, because resilience is a one of the key values of my digital products firm, DSD.
- 👀 I’m interested in Shiny apps, statistics, AI-ML, and cyber resiliency.
- 🌱 I’m always learning more R, Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Shiny apps for enterprise, dashboards for strategic insights, statistical analysis and data cleaning.
- 📫 How to reach me: millerauthor@datascientistdude.com for business inquiries please.
- 😄 Dad Joke of the Day: What did the big flower say to the little flower? "Hi, bud!"
- 😄 Bonus Joke: My girlfriend borrowed $100 from me. After 3 years, when we separated, she returned exactly $100. I lost interest in the relationship.  I was all a-loan.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a (former) Russian/Ukrainian linguist.
